# December 2022 Advent of Code

This is my first time trying AoC! So far so good, it is a fun series of little
problems to solve.

I've also just found out more about the F# programming language. I am so pleased
with it that I want to stop using all of my other languages. Especially compared
to C#, F# just shines so bright!
